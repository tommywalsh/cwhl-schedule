This is a simple Python script that outputs a schedule for a fantasy sports league.

The code is fairly specific to one particular league and one particular season,
but hopefully it can be modified/generalized in the future if/when needs change.

I can't imagine anyone else wanting to use this code, but if so, feel free.
